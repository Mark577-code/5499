# Development of a Love Confession Template Generation Webpage

## Functional Requirements
1. **User Login Interface**:
    - It should have a simple and intuitive design, including input fields for username and password, as well as login and registration buttons.
    - The registration function should collect necessary information such as username, password, password confirmation, and email address. Ensure password strength requirements are met, and after successful registration, automatically redirect to the login page.
    - During login, verify the username and password. Provide friendly error messages like "Incorrect username or password. Please try again." After successful login, redirect to the home page.
    - Provide a "Forgot Password" function. Reset the password via email by sending an email containing a reset link to the user's registered email address.
2. **Home Page**:
    - Have an attractive background image or color theme to create a romantic atmosphere, such as a gradient background in pink tones.
    - Prominently display the entrance button for the "Love Confession Template Library". The button design should be appealing, for example, in the shape of a heart or with a dynamic blinking effect.
    - Display thumbnail images and brief introductions of some popular love confession templates to attract users to click and enter the template library for more details.
    - Provide copyright information at the bottom of the page and a link to "About Us". Clicking on "About Us" can pop up a modal box introducing the website team and the purpose of development.
3. **Template Library**:
    - Display love confession templates classified by different styles, such as romantic and literary style, humorous style, simple and straightforward style, etc. Each category should have clear labels and icon identifiers.
    - Each template should be presented in the form of a card, including the template title, a cover image (matching the style), a brief summary, and a "View Details" button.
    - Clicking on the "View Details" button enters the template details page, which displays the complete content of the love confession. The text layout should be elegant, and key sentences can be highlighted. Meanwhile, provide a "Copy Text" button to make it convenient for users to directly copy the content for use elsewhere.
    - Provide a search function on the template library page. Users can search for specific love confession templates by keywords, such as the name of the person they want to confess to or specific scenarios (e.g., "Valentine's Day confession").
    - Have a template collection function. After logging in, users can add their favorite templates to their personal collection. There should be a quick access entry for the collection on the home page after logging in, making it convenient for users to quickly find the templates they have collected.

## Technical Implementation
- **Front End**:
    - Use HTML5 and CSS3 to build the page structure and design the styles, and implement a responsive layout to ensure a good browsing experience on different devices (mobile phones, tablets, computers).
    - Use JavaScript to implement the page interaction logic, such as login verification, button click events, modal box display and hiding, search function, collection function, etc. The jQuery library can be used to simplify operations.
    - For dynamic effects on the page, such as button blinking and image switching, use CSS animations or JavaScript animation libraries (such as Animate.css) to achieve them.
- **Back End**:
    - Choose a suitable back-end language, such as the Django framework of Python or the Express framework of Node.js.
    - Set up a user database to store user information (username, password, email, etc.). Use database encryption technology to ensure the security of user passwords.
    - Build back-end APIs to implement interfaces for user registration, login, password recovery, template retrieval, search, collection and other functions, and conduct data interaction with the front end. Adopt RESTful-style API design to ensure the simplicity and ease of use of the interfaces.

## Other Requirements
- Focus on user experience, ensure fast page loading speed and smooth operation, and avoid lagging or slow loading.
    - During the design process, consider the scalability of the website so that it will be convenient to add new template styles and functional modules in the future.
    - Conduct sufficient testing, including functional testing, compatibility testing, security testing, etc., to ensure that the website operates stably and reliably after going online without obvious loopholes and errors.
